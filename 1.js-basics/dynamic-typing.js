// Wihtin variables you have 2 types of languages: static and dynamic
// Static = cannot be changed in the future = string name = 'Ben';
// Dynamic = can be changed in the future = let...

let name = 'Ben'; 
let age = 34;
let isApproved = true; 
let firstName; // if not declared this is Undefined
let lastName = null; 

console.log(name);


// The type of variable is dynamic based no the type value assigned to it. If name (above) was changed to 1 then the console would recignise the change in type from String to Number
