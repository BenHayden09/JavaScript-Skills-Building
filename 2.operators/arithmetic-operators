//if you place the increment second (x++) you will show the number stated and the it will be incremented by 1. However, you will only see this once you pass a long for this a second time
// to see this work as it shoud, remove the console.log above to cancel out the increment set before

//10 and then decremented by 1 (will only show when you create a new console.log)
