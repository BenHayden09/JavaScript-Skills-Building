//to increase a value by more than 1 (++)
x = x + 5;
console.log(x);
x += 5;

//10 = 10 + 5 = 15
//lines 6 and 7 are the same

//multiplied by a given value
x = x * 3;
x *= 3;

// NOTE if you send this to the console it will read as multiple calculations. This just demonstrates different ways to add value and not to find a new end value.
// You can also use any of the arithmetic operators learnt for this.
